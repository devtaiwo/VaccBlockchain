# Setting up the development environment
There are a few technical requirements before we start. Please install the following:

    Node.js v6+ LTS and npm (comes with Node)
    Git

# Instructions:
1. Download the complete repository and go to the folder in your terminal

2. Run the development console.

        truffle develop

3. Compile and migrate the smart contracts. Note inside the development console we don't preface commands with truffle.

        compile
        migrate

4. Open another ternminal and Run the liteserver development server (outside the development console) for front-end hot   reloading. 
   Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.
